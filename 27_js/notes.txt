nothing notable has occurred
so perhaps I shall explain myself here

you might be thinking
"Tomas what is wrong with you?
 what are you doing with your fib-helper?
 you know you can save yourself from some pointless addition right?
 just return b when n = 1
 don't wait until b shifts to a and n = 0"
and to that I respond
"well then I would have to account for when n = 0 in fib
 and I thought the functions looked cleaner without such accounting
 yah
 perhaps I'll regret this decision tomorrow
 and change it to the more efficient version then"

the other day a Noakai said
"so the recursive fibonacci solution is pretty much just fancy iteration"
and now that I think about it, his words were true
so in normal scenarios, one would do recursion in racket
cause it's easier there
and they would do iteration in javascript
cause it's easier there
at least for this problem
and the factorial one too
